## This demo is a basic example of how we approach building analytics-centric applications. The three primary goals of our approach are:

## 1. **Availabilty**: We ensure the data is available in every possible and relevant way.

## 2. **Portability**: We provide you with the ability to take the data you see on the page with you via exports.

## 3. **Visibility**: We provide interactive visualizations to give clients the ability to analyze the data from multiple angles.

## This example is only the baseline, we are limited only by the client's scope.

# Technology

We use whatever modern technology is best suited for the job. Any number of our products will use one or all of the following tech, depending on the size and scope of the project. This demo uses all the technology listed below.

- **React**: We use react.js to build the frontend of this application. React gives us the flexibility and efficiency to build reusable web components.
- **Nextjs**: We use nextjs as a Reactjs Framework. This framework provides our team with a strong foundation from which we can build scalable, production-grade applications.
- **D3**: We use data visualization libraries that are built on D3.
- **Django**: When the project requires a massive amount of data collection, automation, calculations, predictions, and a more robust database, we rope in the Django Web Framework. Written in python, Django gives our team a powerful tool to build complex data-centric backends.

# Primary Features

- **Dashboard:** The Data Dashboard is the first stop when entering the application. This dashboard provides the user with relevant data in a few different forms. It also displays the data in table form.
- **Data Comparison:** This module takes data comparison to the next level. You have the ability to compare specific data points and export that data set as a report. All compared data is visualized.
- **Upload:** A common struggle when dealing with data on the web is keeping it up to date. Maybe you have your own spreadsheet that you work off of and only need to update the app when occasionally. The bulk upload tool allows you to import your spreadsheet directly into the database. All data is checked, cleaned, validated and analyzed prior to import. The application then bucketizes the data into "what needs to be updated (i.e. existing data), and what needs to be created (i.e. new data).
- **Geo:** No data platform would be complete without some geo charts.

# Possible Use Cases and Benefits

There are a multitude of possible uses for a data plaform such as this. We've taken massive/complex spreadsheets and processes and created bespoke data solutions using the technology in this demo. No problem is too small or too large.
